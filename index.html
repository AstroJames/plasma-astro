    Welcome to the CITA Theoretical Plasma Group website. We are a group of researchers at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) at the University of Toronto. Our research focuses on the physics of plasmas in a large variety of astrophysical environments. We use a combination of analytical theory, numerical simulations (Newtonian and relativistic PIC and fluids), and observational data to study of the plasma Universe around us.
